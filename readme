What is it
~~~~
###A wrapper around the libmad library that manages mp3 operations

UPDATE

Initial id3v2 support in example madplayer app.

What does it do
~~~~
###You execute the PlayMP3 function with a filename.
###
###The callback will be executed during the decoding of the mp3.  Be sure
###to return from this function quickly else the audio may stutter or freeze.

UPDATE

Specify mp3 using command line argument and madplay.elf

Compiling
~~~~
I setup the following env vars:
export LIBMAD=$LIBMP3/libmad
export LIBID3TAG=$LIBMP3/libid3tag
export ZLIB=.... wherever

I had to rename zlib.a to libzlib.a.

It doesn't work!
~~~~
I use a PAL PS2 running ps2link, and I upload via ps2client from a
unix environment.  Let me know if it works in a different environment.

If you suspect these conditions are not at fault, I'd suggest trying
these things:

 - check the filename prefix, eg: host:test.mp3 
 - try a different mp3
 - private message me on #ps2dev or forums.ps2dev.org with all of the details.
 - remember, all of the details

Limitations
~~~~
Lots of wasted cpu

I commented out CDVD support.
