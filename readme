What is it
~~~~
A wrapper around the libmad library that manages mp3 operations

UPDATE

Initial id3v2 support in example madplayer app.

What does it do
~~~~
You execute the PlayMP3 function with a filename.

The callback will be executed during the decoding of the mp3.  Be sure
to return from this function quickly else the audio may stutter or freeze.

UPDATE

Specify mp3 using command line argument and madplay.elf

Compiling
~~~~
I setup the following env vars:
export LIBMP3=$PS2DEV/libmp3
export LIBMAD=$LIBMP3/libmad
export LIBID3TAG=$LIBMP3/libid3tag
export ZLIB=.... wherever

I had to rename zlib.a to libzlib.a.

It doesn't work!
~~~~
I use a PAL PS2 running ps2link, and I upload via ps2client from a
unix environment.  Let me know if it works in a different environment.

If you suspect these conditions are not at fault, I'd suggest trying
these things:

 - check the filename prefix, eg: host:test.mp3 
 - try a different mp3
 - private message me on #ps2dev or forums.ps2dev.org with all of the details.
 - remember, all of the details

Limitations
~~~~
Lots of wasted cpu
