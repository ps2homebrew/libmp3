What is it
~~~~
A wrapper around the libmad library that manages mp3 operations

What does it do
~~~~
You execute the PlayMP3 function with a filename.

The callback will be executed during the decoding of the mp3.  Be sure
to return from this function quickly else the audio may stutter or freeze.

Compiling
~~~~
I setup the environment variables LIBMP3 and LIBMAD.  eg:
export LIBMP3=$PS2DEV/libmp3
export LIBMAD=$LIBMP3/libmad

Also included is libcdvdfs.a and libsample.a.  I believe these 
can also be found in other projects on cvs.ps2dev.org.

Requirements
~~~~
usbd.irx - I use an official Sony release.  Let me know if the
ps2sdk release works for you.

It doesn't work!
~~~~
I use a PAL PS2 running ps2link, and I upload via ps2client from a
unix environment.  Let me know if it works in a different environment.

If you suspect these conditions are not at fault, I'd suggest trying
these things:

 - check the filename prefix, eg: host:test.mp3 
 - try a different mp3
 - private message me on #ps2dev or forums.ps2dev.org with all of the details.
 - remember, all of the details

Limitations
~~~~
Asynchronous playback is not supported.
